						Destination: Kauai
					</h2>

						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauai">
							Kauai
						</a> is a tropical island paradise in the Hawaiian Island
						chain. The island is lush with vegetation and has been well 
						maintained, having contemporary civic services like water, 
						waste, transportation, ecological reservation areas etc. 
						During my stay in Kauai there was precious little threat of
						calamity occurring, although it is in an active volcanic 
						region the island of Kauai has not seen an eruption in 
						perhaps 
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_hotspot#Wilson.27s_stationary_hotspot_theory">
							5.5 million years.
						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						My travel agent suggested renting a car on this island 
						given the transit system is less well developed than most
						metropolitan areas. Travelling around the island is really
						an exceptional experience, and I would definitely second 
						this suggestion to anyone making it a holiday destination.
						The island exuded an aura of peaceful paradise throughout
						my stay there, and if asked I just might say this is probably
						the closest to paradise I have ever come in this life. The
						sun is warm in December not hot, even though the temperature 
						may be listed close to 30 degrees you may not even realize it.
						Throughout the day clouds frequent the north and east sides 
						of the island where most people live. These clouds bring a 
						<a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/kauai/769395">
							delightful rain</a>
						which if you are lucky to experience, is most
						likely warm to touch.

						Helicopter Ride
					</h2>			
					<div id="transition_image_right">

					</div>
					<p>
						I decided to take a friend with me on my vacations, because 
						normal travel services reduce the costs to have more than 
						one person on the trip. The person I took on this trip 
						demanded that we take a helicopter ride around the island.
						Initially I argued against it, because the cost of a 
						helicopter ride is so very expensive, however I soon 
						realized that taking a helicopter trip on this island would
						be simply unforgettable. Luckily the weather on this day 
						was exceptional and there were so many unique sites to see,
						it was well worth the price of admission. To top this off the 
						<a href="http://www.bluehawaiian.com/">Blue Hawaiian</a> 
						helicopter group provided a full movie of the entire trip
						for a very low price.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Our First stop was a waterfall where Jurassic Park was 
						filmed, we then flew over Waimea Canyon which looks pretty
						much the same as the Grand Canyon. After this we flew to the
						west side of the island and around the jagged Napali mountain 
						coast. We discovered this is one of the only areas of the 
						island specifically unaccessible by road, however the sharp
						inclines are amazing, green, and spotted with many waterfalls.
						On the way back we flew over Hanalei Bay, to the highest 
						mountain and rainiest area on the island. Then down to the
						plains areas of the east side of the island, ending with a
						great fly over of the Fantasy Island waterfall called,
						"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wailua_Falls">Wailua Falls</a>"

					<h2>
						Deserted Beach
					</h2>
					<div id="transition_image">
						<img id="island_image" src="images/kauai/beach_jeep.jpg" alt="Drive The Beach" />
						<img id="map_image" src="images/kauai/beach_deserted.jpg" alt="I can see for miles" />
					</div>						
					<p> 
						With a rent-a-car you can see many of the amazing sites of 
						Kauai up close, and avoid the expensive cost of a tour 
						company. Polihale Beach is at the west end of the island, 
						and the only way to get there is to drive. Some people 
						like to drive right onto the beach, and given it is such 
						a vast area that is largely undeveloped, it appears to be
						a well sanctioned thing to do (provided you can also make
						it off the beach). You can also travel along a road over top 
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimea_Canyon_State_Park">Waimea Canyon</a>
						to the various lookouts over the canyon, and lookouts that 
						point westward over the Napali Coast peaks. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Perhaps the most surprising thing I saw in Kauai were the
						tents on a beach near 
						<a href="http://www.kauai.com/salt-pond-beach">Hanapepe</a>
						This semi circle beach/water area allows tents and visitors 
						to get much closer to an outdoors Hawaiian experience. After
						snorkelling on this beach it rained, and several rainbows 
						appeared. The beauty of this place was surreal, and everyone 
						we met seemed to know how true it is.

					<h2>
						Fun 4 Free
					</h2>
					<div id="transition_image_right">
						<img id="island_image" src="images/kauai/fish.jpg" alt="Lydgate State Park" />
						<img id="map_image" src="images/kauai/waterfall.jpg" alt="Hanakapiai Falls" />
					</div>					
					<p>
						Snorkelling should be a major part of anyone's trip to Hawaii.
						There are a few simple things that if you remember when booking
						a trip will help you have instant fun, right from the door
						of your hotel room. Always make sure to book a hotel that is
						really close to a sheltered beach. A sheltered beach will have 
						wall around a section of ocean close to shore that prevent any 
						large agressive fish from entering it. This protection will also 
						bring closer to you the	smaller fish that seek the protection of 
						shallow waters. Early in the morning of any trip to a tropical 
						island, take your snorkel and mask for a swim to see the fishes. 
						It will give you so much energy to see the new fishes living 
						underwater that you	won't be able to stop all day. It is energy 
						like this that pushed me to go so many places on the island.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						On one such day I drove to the north side of the Island to Hanalei
						Bay to surf. On another day we went to the very end of the northern
						road to <a href="http://www.kauai.com/hanakapiai-trail">Hanakapiai Falls</a>.
						The hiking trail to these falls is called Kalalau. The trail goes 
						along the coast for a few kilometers and then after crossing a 
						larger stream, heads south into the island for roughly the same 
						distance, up to the waterfall. It is quite likely that the trail 
						will be slippery and wet with red mud, but the trip to the falls is so worth it.
						Along the way we managed to find a wild orange tree bursting with 
						fruit. At the falls the water is so cold and pure, and the falling
						water really hits you from above. When we returned to the trailhead,
						Ke'e Beach beach served as an excellent place to shower off, or go
						for a nice salt water dip.
