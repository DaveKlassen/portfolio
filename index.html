					<p> 
						This website was created to provide potential clients with a way to get
						a health insurance plan quote for their family. The task was to make an 
						appealing form design 
						that would respond to a numerous number of devices, and provide a simple
						experience that leads the user through the process of getting a quote or 
						submitting an application for health insurance. The form design for the 
						site was required to be highly customizable, and maintain usability during
						the application process. We chose to use NodeJS and React for this site since
						both frameworks allow for using the latest developments in Javascript (ES6/ES7).

					</a>
					<p>
						These web apps were an experiment in using AngularJS. I started with 
						Angular1 and jumped to using Angular4 in future projects. Angular4 adds so 
						many new things including TypeScript and ES6 related syntax. While I am 
						just starting into Angular my experience with ES6 for ReactJS, tells me 
						there is so much more to uncover here. I also tried to create some 
						interesting pure Javascript code, since when I experimented with this 
						with an AJAX Hockey App, I was amazed at what is possible. In the emailApp
						I creatd my own editable dropdown input field (so neat).

						This website was created to provide responsive design in a layout using 
						HTML5 and experimental CSS3 related features. The page content describes 
						a few vacations I have been able to take over the years (and was the 
						baseline for this site). The content expands horizonatally as the browser 
						widens. The menu and navigation stays-on-top if the browser(view port) is 
						significantly large, otherwise (ie. for mobile devices) it is simply a 
						part of the page. The bottom footer is sticky and will stick firmly to 
						the bottom section of the browser as long as the content does not exceed 
						the browser page height.

						This Flash Movie was created by a team of five people (Writer, Director, Artist, 
						and Programmers), as a part of the 
						<a href="http://thecdm.ca/">Masters of Digital Media</a>(MDM) Program at the 
						Center for Digital Media. I helped create the Flash interactivity and attempted 
						to integrate smoothly with the film, without taking away from the flow of action. 
						It was a group effort so I can really only take credit for reading a book on 
						Flash, however I hope you'll agree it is an interesting piece which with today's 
						broadband access allows for significant accessibility, interaction and enjoyment.

						This Drupal website was created by a team of six people (Project Manager, 
						Writer, Director, Artists, and Programmer), as a part of the 
						<a href="http://thecdm.ca/">Masters of Digital Media</a>(MDM) Program at 
						the Center for Digital Media. I helped create this Drupal website in order 
						to share video information and content focused on informing people about 
						issues of Locality within different geographic areas. We had a few user 
						stories we wanted to communicate to viewers. The goal was to allow people 
						to post YouTube/Vimeo videos on the site using pre-made Drupal modules. 
						What follows are the videos and information we collected to describe 
						Vancouver.

							Javascript example describing the dangers behind unvalidated redirects,

						This program was the subject of an intense practicum I completed at BCIT, in

						SCADA Systems. It was designed to operate on an Intrinsyc PXA270 embedded Linux 
						board (ie. a handheld sized board). The configuration provides a firewall that 
						does not allow any external access. If external access is required a remote client 
						can request to open a port by using a custom encryption channel. In this way access 
						through the firewall to the internal network is only available to those that know 
						the custom encryption/protocol. Access is further monitored by a configuration file 
						that can be as restrictive as required

						This website was an experiment in using Responsive Web Design to allow
						for any device to follow through a number of screens to complete the
						application process for a simple small loan. Depending on the size of the 
						device screen a different number of fields are presented, so that the user
						never needs to scroll through a page to see all the fields.
						Numerous cross/browser/platform issues were addressed,
						in order to ensure the user could view some help text and also enter data
						without having to do anything other than tap a field, enter data, and click 
						a button to proceed to the next screen.
